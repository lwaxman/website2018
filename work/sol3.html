            <p>Sol-3 (short for &ldquo;Solar 3,&rdquo; the third planet from the sun) is an illustrated art book featuring an urban landscape in which everything is trash. It is an accordion fold book of one continuous illustration that I drew by hand in felt-tip marker, scanned, and printed on a risograph printer. Each page is 8.5x14" and illustrated at a one-to-one ratio; when open flat, it measures 8.5x126".</p>
			<p class="blockquote">Sol-3 is only eight thousand miles in diameter, which is almost a negligible dimension in the great vastness of space. It was so extraordinarily well invented and designed that to the best of our knowledge its residents have been on board it for two million years not even knowing that they were on board a ship. But these residents of Sol-3 are not going to be able to operate their spaceship successfully nor for much longer unless they come to see it as a whole spaceship and their fate as common. It has to be everybody or nobody. <br><br>—adapted from Buckminster Fuller, &ldquo;Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth&rdquo;</p>
